# Deep-Learning-Portfolio
There are two main reasons I created this repository.
1) Show off my deep learning projects.
2) Strengthen my understanding of deep learning concepts while trying to explain others. 


# Neural Network

` The core idea of neural networks is to compute weighted sums of the values in the input layer and create a mapping between the input and output layer by a series of functions (in general, nonlinear functions)`


# Perceptron

# Common Problems in Neural Network

## Overfitting and Underfitting

Underfitting is trying to kill a Godzilla with a flyswatter. The problem is you are oversimplifying the problem. Overfitting, on the other hand, is trying to kill a fly with a bazooka. The problem here is, well, it is obvious. You are overcomplicating it!

Another good example I saw today was not studying the exam and ultimately failing to be an example of underfitting while memorizing the book word by word rather than studying, is an example of overfitting. Either way, you will fail.

### Solutions for underfitting

#### Regularization 

#### Dropout

## Local Minimum
