# Deep-Learning-Portfolio
There are two main reasons I created this repository.
1) Show off my deep learning projects.
2) Strengthen my understanding of deep learning concepts while trying to explain others. 


# Convolutional Neural Network

Convolution. It is a bit weird word, isn't it?  Originally, it refers to a mathematical combination of two functions to produce third functions. We will come to what it refers to in terms of deep learning in a bit. Before that, let's talk about why CNN?

CNN is a deep learning algorithm that differs from traditional multi-layer perceptrons(MLP) in a couple of smart ways. In MLP (also known as vanilla neural network), we have an input vector that is fully connected along with associated weights to the hidden layer, which is again connected to another hidden layer and so on until we get to the final/output layer. MLP uses a perceptron for each pixel in an image and assigns a weight to each perceptron. With real word image classification problems, the number of pixels increases, which ultimately makes the MLP  undesirable approach. The chance of overfitting arises as each layer is fully connected to the previous and next layer. 

As we see from above reasons, CNN is better option and state-of-art algorithm for image classification problem.
