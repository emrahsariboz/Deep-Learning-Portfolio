# Deep-Learning-Portfolio
There are two main reasons I created this repository.
1) Show off my deep learning projects.
2) Strengthen my understanding of deep learning concepts while trying to explain others. 


# Neural Network

` The core idea of neural networks is to compute weighted sums of the values in the input layer and create a mapping between the input and output layer by a series of functions (in general, nonlinear functions)`

At the core, NN takes input and multiplies it with weights to predict an output.

Another good example I saw today ot studying the exam and ultimately failing to be an example of underfitting while memorizing the book word by word rather than studying, is an example of overfitting. Either way, you wi
