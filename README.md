# Deep-Learning-Portfolio
There are two main reasons I created this repository.
1) Show off my deep learning projects.
2) Strengthen my understanding of deep learning concepts while trying to explain others. 


# Neural Network

` The core idea of neural networks is to compute weighted sums of the values in the input layer and create a mapping between the input and output layer by a series of functions (in general, nonlinear functions)`
